# MongoDB Jupyter Notebooks Collection

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks designed to demonstrate various MongoDB functionalities, focusing on Atlas Search, VectorSearch, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Langchain, and basic MongoDB CRUD operations. These notebooks are intended to provide a practical, hands-on approach to learning and implementing MongoDB's powerful features in your projects.

## Features

- **Atlas Search**: Notebooks covering the integration and utilization of MongoDB Atlas's full-text search capabilities.
- **VectorSearch**: Demonstrations of vector search functionalities within MongoDB, enabling semantic search capabilities.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Examples of leveraging retrieval-augmented generation for enhancing language model predictions with database searches.
- **Langchain**: Tutorials on using the Langchain library for building language applications with MongoDB.
- **Basic MongoDB CRUD**: Notebooks that go through the basics of creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents in MongoDB.
