To construct native AI applications, such as a realistic, end-stage optimized chatbot, you require significantly more than just a vector store. The knowledge chunks within should support transactional operations, managed through a CRUD application interface layered above. Here are some resources and examples to help you along the way.

# MongoDB Jupyter Notebooks Collection

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks designed to demonstrate various MongoDB functionalities, focusing on Atlas Search, VectorSearch, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Langchain, and basic MongoDB CRUD operations. These notebooks are intended to provide a practical, hands-on approach to learning and implementing MongoDB's powerful features in your projects.

## Features

- **Atlas Search**: Notebooks covering the integration and utilization of MongoDB Atlas's full-text search capabilities.
- **VectorSearch**: Demonstrations of vector search functionalities within MongoDB, enabling semantic search capabilities.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Examples of leveraging retrieval-augmented generation for enhancing language model predictions with database searches.
- **Langchain**: Tutorials on using the Langchain library for building language applications with MongoDB.
- **Basic MongoDB CRUD**: Notebooks that go through the basics of creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents in MongoDB.

## Getting Started

To get started with these notebooks, clone this repository to your local machine or Jupyter environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/voxic/MongoDB_Notebooks
```

Ensure you have MongoDB set up in your environment, and if you're working with Atlas, ensure your cluster is configured correctly.

## Prerequisites

- Jupyter or JupyterLab
